# Testing branch if not equal functionality
RHM     0,  0, 16 #0 - load a matrix of values with control writethrough
RHM    16, 16, 16 #1 - load a matrix with a one in the top left and control block
RW      0         #2 - load w0, which has the identity matrix in data and the control sets PC -= 2 if ACTivated
MMC.SO  0,  0, 16 #3 - multiply value matrix with w0 into acc0. no ACT so no branch
RW      0         #4 - load w0 again
MMC.S   0, 16, 16 #5 - multiple one matrix with w0 (no control) and add to acc0, which does have control
ACT     0,  0, 16 #6 - flagless activation copies acc0 to ub0 and branches to pc=4 if acc0[0][0] != 10
WHM     0,  0, 16 #7 - if here, then acc0[0][0] = 10, so write ub0 back to hm0
HLT               #8 - halt and print hostmem
